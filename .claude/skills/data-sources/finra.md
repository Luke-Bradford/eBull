# FINRA — source-of-truth note

> Status: introduced 2026-05-18 alongside PR for #915 (Phase 6 PR 11).
> First non-SEC data provider family.
> Cross-reference: `.claude/skills/data-engineer/etl-endpoint-coverage.md` §2 (`finra_short_interest` row) + §7 G6.

## 1. What FINRA publishes (in-scope for eBull v1)

| Endpoint | Cadence | URL pattern | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Equity Short Interest (bimonthly) | 15th + last business day | `https://cdn.finra.org/equity/otcmarket/biweekly/shrt{YYYYMMDD}.csv` | ✅ WIRED 2026-05-18 (#915) |
| RegSHO Daily Short Volume | Daily, EOD ~6pm ET | `https://cdn.finra.org/equity/regsho/daily/{PREFIX}shvol{YYYYMMDD}.txt` × 6 prefixes | ✅ WIRED 2026-05-18 (#916) |

Both endpoints are **anonymous CDN** — no OAuth, no API key, no developer-portal registration. The catalog page IS the contract; `cdn.finra.org/robots.txt` returns 403 but the public catalog page does not restrict programmatic anonymous download.

## 2. File format gotchas

### 2.1 `.csv` extension lies — files are pipe-delimited

Despite the `.csv` extension on bimonthly files, they are **pipe-delimited (`|`)**. Parse via `csv.DictReader(stream, delimiter='|')`. Empirically verified 2026-05-18 against `shrt20260430.csv` (~10k rows, 14 columns).

### 2.2 Bimonthly file 14-column header (exact)

```
accountingYearMonthNumber|symbolCode|issueName|issuerServicesGroupExchangeCode|marketClassCode|currentShortPositionQuantity|previousShortPositionQuantity|stockSplitFlag|averageDailyVolumeQuantity|daysToCoverQuantity|revisionFlag|changePercent|changePreviousNumber|settlementDate
```

Header mismatch / missing field = file-level fatal (`HeaderCorruptionError` in `app/services/finra_short_interest_ingest.py`).

### 2.3 RegSHO daily 6-column header (exact)

```
Date|Symbol|ShortVolume|ShortExemptVolume|TotalVolume|Market
```

Six prefixes per day (`CNMSshvol{YYYYMMDD}.txt`, `FNQCshvol...`, `FNRAshvol...`, `FNSQshvol...`, `FNYXshvol...`, `FORFshvol...`) — each represents a separate reporting facility (Consolidated NMS, FINRA/NASDAQ TRF Chicago, ADF, FINRA/NASDAQ TRF Carteret, FINRA/NYSE TRF, ORF respectively). Operator UI typically aggregates `CNMS` as the canonical figure; the others are facility-attribution detail.

### 2.4 RegSHO daily — decimal volumes + comma-joined `Market` on CNMS (#916)

Empirically verified 2026-05-18 in spike §3.3/§3.4: `ShortVolume`, `ShortExemptVolume`, `TotalVolume` are **DECIMAL** (6 decimal places), not integer. FINRA reports per-symbol weighted aggregates across reporting facilities. Schema column is `NUMERIC(18, 6)`.

`Market` column shape:

- Non-CNMS prefixes: single-character facility code (e.g. `B`, `Q`, `N`, `O`).
- CNMS aggregate: **comma-joined union** of all facilities reporting volume for that `(symbol, trade_date)` (e.g. `B,Q,N`). PK on `finra_regsho_daily_observations` includes `market` so the CNMS aggregate row coexists with per-facility breakdown rows for the same `(instrument, trade_date)`.

### 2.5 RegSHO daily — footer is single-int row count (#916)

Every RegSHO daily file (CNMS + 5 per-facility prefixes) ends with a single line containing the integer count of body rows. Parser asserts `parsed_body_row_count == footer_int` and raises `HeaderCorruptionError` on mismatch (structural defect). Empty-body files (FNRA legitimate-empty shape) have header + footer `0` — success path with zero observations + manifest row still written.

### 2.6 RegSHO daily — body `Date` must match URL/caller date (#916)

For every body row, the parser asserts `row.Date == trade_date.strftime('%Y%m%d')`. A CDN path mistake or fixture seeded under the wrong date would silently write facts under the caller's `trade_date` while ignoring the body's date column. Mismatch raises `HeaderCorruptionError` mid-body — caller's txn rolls back atomically.

### 2.7 BOTH CDNs return 403 (not 404) for not-yet-published files (#916, corrected #2234)

Empirically verified 2026-05-18 in live-smoke against `cdn.finra.org/equity/regsho/daily/`: requesting a file for a trade date BEFORE the EOD ~6 PM ET publication window returns **HTTP 403 Forbidden**, not 404.

⚠ **Corrected 2026-08-06 (#2234), applied 2026-08-08 (#2336).** This section used to say the bimonthly CDN (`/equity/otcmarket/biweekly/`) returns 404, and that its provider "only maps 404". Both false: the bimonthly CDN answers an undesignated or unpublished settlement date with **403 and a 111-byte body**, and `app/providers/implementations/finra_short_interest.py:122` has mapped 403 + 404 since #916. The skill had drifted away from the code in the direction that HIDES a bug — #2234's derived-calendar defect was invisible precisely because a permanently-undesignated date and a not-yet-published one produce the same 403.

Both providers (`FinraRegShoProvider.fetch_regsho_daily_file`, `FinraShortInterestProvider.fetch_settlement_file`) map **403 + 404 → `FinraNotFound`** so the cron can safely run before publication. Future FINRA endpoints should default to 403+404 = not-found UNLESS empirically verified otherwise — FINRA uses 403 as a "missing object" idiom on both hosts.

**Cross-source 403 idiom:** SEC's `efts.sec.gov` exhibits a similar "403 ≠ permanent" pattern on weekends — see `.claude/skills/data-sources/sec-edgar.md` §4 "Multi-host shared clock" for the SEC analogue. **Rule for new sources:** never default-treat 403 as "permanently unavailable" without an empirical probe against a known-good vs known-not-yet-published case for that specific CDN/host. The cost of mis-classifying transient 403 as permanent is silent gap; the cost of treating permanent 403 as transient is wasted budget. Probe both directions.

### 2.8 Encoding contract per file

| File | Encoding | Validation site |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bimonthly `shrt{YYYYMMDD}.csv` (pipe-delimited) | UTF-8 | `finra_short_interest_ingest.py:189` (`raw_bytes.decode("utf-8")`) |
| RegSHO daily `{PREFIX}shvol{YYYYMMDD}.txt` (pipe-delimited) | UTF-8 | `finra_regsho_ingest.py:112` (`raw_bytes.decode("utf-8")`) |

Both files are pure ASCII in practice (ticker symbols + integers + dates + decimals — no diacritics or non-Latin chars). UTF-8 decode is a defensive contract; any decode error on a 200-response body indicates fixture corruption or a FINRA encoding-change incident — bubble to `HeaderCorruptionError`, do NOT silent-replace with `errors='replace'`. SEC's `getcurrent` Atom feed uses `ISO-8859-1` for filer names with diacritics; FINRA's universe is US-only and has no analogue.

### 2.9 Symbol form — alphanumeric only, NO separators

FINRA strips dot / hyphen / underscore from share-class siblings + preferreds:

- `ABRPRD` (FINRA) = Arbor Realty Trust **Preferred D** → vendor `ABR.PR.D` / `ABR-D`
- `ALLPRB` (FINRA) = Allstate Preferred B → vendor `ALL-PR-B`
- `BRKA` (FINRA) ≠ `BRK.A` (our `instruments.symbol` dotted form)

Resolution discipline at the service layer: strip non-alphanumerics + upper-case on BOTH sides before matching. The G6 PR uses `app.services.finra_short_interest_ingest.normalise_symbol` (public name — no leading underscore; `finra_short_interest_ingest.py:105`).

Collision handling: two instruments whose symbols collapse to the same normalised key (e.g. `ABR.PRD` + `ABRPRD` both → `ABRPRD`) get tracked in `ambiguous_keys` and the offending FINRA row is skipped with `skipped_ambiguous_symbol` incremented.

### 2.10 Cohort cliff — pre-June 2021 archive is OTC-only

Pre-June 2021 FINRA short interest files included **only OTC securities** (FINRA was the only SRO publishing for OTC). Post-June 2021 the file expanded to include exchange-listed securities. The GME 2021-Q1 squeeze settlement window is therefore **NOT in the bimonthly archive** as an exchange-listed cohort entry — only its OTC tape (which doesn't include exchange-listed `GME`). Smoke targets MUST land in the post-2021-06 cohort (e.g. 2021-07-15 first, 2026-04-30 most recent).

## 3. Rate-limit posture

FINRA publishes no explicit rate limit on the equity short interest catalog page. Default polite floor in eBull: **1 req/s** (`_FINRA_MIN_INTERVAL_S = 1.0` at `app/providers/implementations/finra_short_interest.py:50`, passed as `min_request_interval_s`).

`cdn.finra.org` is a **separate host** from SEC EDGAR (`data.sec.gov` / `www.sec.gov`). Rate budgets do NOT share. eBull's `Lane` Literal includes a dedicated `finra` lane (added 2026-05-18 alongside #915) so:

- Bumping FINRA fetch concurrency does not burn SEC budget.
- The module-global `_FINRA_RATE_LIMIT_CLOCK` + `_FINRA_RATE_LIMIT_LOCK` are shared across every `FinraShortInterestProvider` instance in-process (prevention-log #726 invariant).

## 4. Architecture in eBull — Option A (ScheduledJob owns writes)

FINRA bimonthly short interest:

- **ScheduledJob** `finra_short_interest_refresh` (daily 12:00 UTC) — owns discovery + fetch + parse + UPSERT into `finra_short_interest_observations` + `finra_short_interest_current`.
- **Manifest parser** `app/services/manifest_parsers/finra_short_interest.py` — **synth no-op** (sec_xbrl_facts G7 precedent). Manifest row dispatches only on `sec_rebuild --source=finra_short_interest`; the parser marks the row `parsed` without doing any real work.
- **Backfill** — REPL runbook against `run_finra_short_interest_refresh(conn, backfill_window_days=N)`. v1 manual-trigger surface is zero-param (POST `/jobs/finra_short_interest_refresh/run` runs the default 400-day window).

FINRA RegSHO daily short volume (#916):

- **ScheduledJob** `finra_regsho_daily_refresh` (daily 23:00 UTC) — owns discovery + fetch + parse + UPSERT into `finra_regsho_daily_observations` (no `_current` snapshot; daily file IS the snapshot). Iterates `(weekday trade_date, prefix)` pairs across the 6 prefixes per day.
- **Provider sibling** `app/providers/implementations/finra_regsho.py` — imports `_FINRA_RATE_LIMIT_CLOCK` + `_FINRA_RATE_LIMIT_LOCK` from the bimonthly module so combined bimonthly + daily fetch never exceeds 1 req/s in-process.
- **Manifest parser** `app/services/manifest_parsers/finra_regsho_daily.py` — synth no-op (same G7 / #915 shape). `parser_version='finra-regsho-daily-v1'`. Subject_id singleton `FINRA_REGSHO`.
- **Backfill** — REPL runbook against `run_finra_regsho_daily_refresh(conn, backfill_window_days=N)`. v1 manual-trigger surface is zero-param (default 30-day window). Extended backfill via REPL (~6 min per 90 days at 1 req/s × 6 prefixes × ~63 trading days).

Per spec §4 + plan §5: the ScheduledJob owns commit/rollback ownership. The service emits SQL only and is wrapped in the JOB's `with conn.transaction():`. Raw-payload-before-parse contract (#1168): `raw_filings.store_raw` + explicit `conn.commit()` happens BEFORE the per-file txn.

## 4.1 `finra_short_interest_current` is latest-WINS, not current-CYCLE (#2336)

`sql/152` defines the `_current` table as a materialised snapshot, one row per instrument,
settled "settlement-date-wins". Read the UPSERT in
`app/services/finra_short_interest_ingest.py` carefully: the `DO UPDATE` arm is guarded
(`EXCLUDED.settlement_date > …`, plus a same-date revision clause), but the **INSERT arm is
unconditional**. So the table means *the latest settlement date we hold for this instrument*,
which is NOT *the current cycle*:

- an instrument that stops appearing in FINRA's file keeps whatever row last named it, forever;
- ingesting an OLD file (a backfill, per §6.1) SEEDS rows for instruments that have no row yet,
  however stale that file is.

Both are correct under the table's own contract. The consequence lands on the READER: a
`_current` row is not evidence that the figure is current.

**Every consumer must bound freshness on `settlement_date`. The bound is exported once —
`app/services/thesis_break.py::FRESHNESS_BOUNDS[…]["finra_settlement"]` — import it, never
restate it.** Consumers today: `thesis_break_scan._short_interest_observations` (via `observe`,
since #2010) and `instrument_analytics._short_interest_from_row` (since #2336; suppressed
signals carry reason `stale_settlement`).

Construction of the 45-day bound, from FINRA's own published schedule
(finra.org/filing-reporting/short-interest): firms report by the second business day after each
designated settlement date, and FINRA publishes roughly a week after that — 2026-01-15 settles,
2026-01-27 publishes, 12 calendar days. With two settlement dates a month, the newest
disseminated figure is therefore up to ~27 calendar days old in normal operation; 45 days is
that plus one missed cycle.

Measured on the dev corpus 2026-08-08 — state the query, never the bare figure, because it drifts:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE current_date - settlement_date <= 45) AS fresh,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE current_date - settlement_date  > 45) AS stale,
       count(*) AS total
  FROM finra_short_interest_current;
--  fresh 5740 | stale 441 | total 6181
```

Of those 441, **19** also carried a `fundamentals_snapshot.shares_outstanding`, i.e. were the
only ones a `short_pct` could be computed from at all; **0 of the 19 appear in the newest
settlement file** (`shrt20260715.csv`, fetched from the CDN this session), so the staleness is
genuine absence from FINRA's file rather than a `_current` row that failed to refresh.

## 5. Revision-window discipline

FINRA publishes **in-place revisions** to bimonthly files (`revisionFlag='Y'`) within 1-2 cycles of the original publication. The ScheduledJob's `_compute_targets` re-fetches the two most-recent candidate dates ALWAYS, regardless of manifest-parsed status, so an in-place revision lands on the next cron fire after FINRA publishes the correction.

## 6. Operator runbooks

### 6.1 First-time bootstrap or extended-window backfill

```bash
docker exec -it ebull-postgres bash  # OR python -c ... locally
python -c "
from psycopg import connect
from app.config import settings
from app.jobs.finra_short_interest_refresh import run_finra_short_interest_refresh
with connect(settings.database_url) as c:
    print(run_finra_short_interest_refresh(c, backfill_window_days=730))
"
```

~48 settlement files at 1 req/s = ~48s wall-clock for a 2-year backfill.

### 6.2 Force-rebuild a specific settlement date

The synth no-op manifest parser doesn't re-ingest — it just re-marks `parsed`. To force re-ingest of one settlement date:

1. `DELETE FROM finra_short_interest_observations WHERE settlement_date = '<date>'` (and `_current` if needed).
2. `DELETE FROM filing_raw_documents WHERE accession_number = 'FINRA_SI_<YYYYMMDD>'` (so `store_raw` re-fetches the body).
3. `UPDATE sec_filing_manifest SET ingest_status='pending' WHERE accession_number = 'FINRA_SI_<YYYYMMDD>'` (cosmetic — gets re-set to `parsed` after the next ScheduledJob fire).
4. Re-fire the ScheduledJob: `POST /jobs/finra_short_interest_refresh/run` (the date is in the revision window if recent, OR within the 400-day window for older dates).

### 6.3 RegSHO daily — extended-window backfill (#916)

```bash
python -c "
from psycopg import connect
from app.config import settings
from app.jobs.finra_regsho_daily_refresh import run_finra_regsho_daily_refresh
with connect(settings.database_url) as c:
    print(run_finra_regsho_daily_refresh(c, backfill_window_days=90))
"
```

90 trading days × 6 prefixes ≈ 378 fetches at 1 req/s ≈ ~6 min wall-clock. Coexists with bimonthly throttle budget — the shared module-global clock serialises.

### 6.4 RegSHO daily partition extension (deadline: before 2035-Q2)

`sql/154` created quarterly partitions 2024-Q1 → 2030-Q1; `sql/174` extended the tail to 2035-Q1 (adds 2030-Q2 → 2035-Q1). Current window: **2024-Q1 → 2035-Q1 inclusive**. The daily cron hard-fails on the first 2035-Q2 trade date unless another migration extends the window before then. The bimonthly sibling `finra_short_interest_observations` shares the hazard — `sql/152` + `sql/176` cover 2021-Q3 → 2035-Q1 with NO DEFAULT partition — so extend both in the same migration. Operator runbook:

1. Author a new migration `sql/NNN_finra_regsho_daily_partition_extension.sql` that adds `2035-Q2` → later quarterly partitions to `finra_regsho_daily_observations` (follow the `sql/174` idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS … PARTITION OF … FOR VALUES FROM (…) TO (…)` loop).
2. Apply via the standard migration path; verify partition count via `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_inherits WHERE inhparent='finra_regsho_daily_observations'::regclass`.

### 6.5 Cross-source sanity check (one ticker)

After ingest, compare `current_short_interest` against:

- `marketbeat.com` short-interest page for the ticker
- `shortsqueeze.com` daily-update page
- `nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/{symbol}/short-interest`

±5% tolerance acknowledged (off-source reporting cadence drift; the FINRA value IS authoritative per regulatory definition).

## 7. What's intentionally NOT covered

- **Short borrow rate / utilisation** — vendor-paid data (S3, IHS Markit). Out of scope per settled-decisions #532 (free regulated-source-only).
- **Per-broker short interest disaggregation** — not published by FINRA.
- **ETF short rebate dynamics** — vendor-paid; out of scope.
- **Real-time / intraday short interest** — FINRA publishes EOD only.

## 8. Forward references
