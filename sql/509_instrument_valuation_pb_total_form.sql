-- 509_instrument_valuation_pb_total_form.sql
--
-- #3903: pb_ratio is market cap / the latest quarter's stored equity in both arms, not price / per-share book value in
-- the legacy arm. Spec: docs/specs/fundamentals/2026-10-20-3903-pb-total-form.md ("Construction").
--
-- The legacy arm divided metric_price by fundamentals_snapshot.book_value: it published 46 values under a refused
-- #3850 cap (SCNI 553x), none where the quarter's share count was NULL or zero, and paired a split-adjusted price with
-- the filing's quarter-end count. P/B is the reciprocal of JKP be_me (bkelly-lab/ReplicationCrisis at 67174c7f170b,
-- GlobalFactors/accounting_chars.sas:1127-1137); the stored shareholders_equity is a proxy for its be_x (#3921).
--
-- Both arms carry pb_equity and pb_equity_end (financial_periods_ttm's latest-quarter shareholders_equity and
-- ttm_end) in place of legacy_pb_ratio; the final SELECT emits neither. pb_ratio = market_cap_live / pb_equity when
-- pb_equity is positive and below Infinity (NaN sorts above it; NUMERIC(20,4) holds no Infinity), the session falls
-- on or before the month-end 18 months after pb_equity_end (JKP max_data_lag, accounting_chars.sas:1075 and
-- main.sas:92-93), no later normalized quarterly or annual period is stored for the instrument (Amendment 1: JKP
-- ends a value at the next value's start, accounting_chars.sas:1074; #3919 reads the later period), and
-- instruments.currency is USD (NULL refuses). market_cap_live is NULL whenever market_cap_reason is set, which
-- subsumes the legacy arm's dual-class and FPI suppression. The legacy arm's row still needs a fundamentals_snapshot
-- row, as before.
--
-- Output columns, order and types of instrument_valuation are unchanged. View replace only; no backfill. The
-- rollback is sql/rollback/509_instrument_valuation_pb_total_form.sql (sql/507's body), applied by a revert PR.
